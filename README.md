## Emily Sesto

I am a creative problem-solver, currently studying at Makers Academy to become a Junior Full Stack Developer. With a background in both the Performing Arts and Biochemistry, Software Development has given me the opportunity to use both halves of my brain equally. At Makers Academy, I have been learning key skills and best coding practices, including object-oriented programming, test-driven development, pair programming, and the ability to easily pick up new programming languages. 

My diverse experience and scientific educational background has enabled me to develop into a well-rounded, detail-oriented and hard-working team member. Most importantly, I am thriving in an industry where I will never be able to stop learning. I am keen to get started with a career in web development and canâ€™t wait to begin contributing my own ideas to the scene.
