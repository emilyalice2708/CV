## Emily Sesto

I am a recent graduate from Makers Academy, where I studied to become a Junior Full Stack Developer. With a background in both the Performing Arts and Biochemistry, Software Development has given me the opportunity to use both my creativity and problem-solving capabilities. At Makers Academy, I have been learning key skills and best coding practices, including object-oriented programming, test-driven development, pair programming, and the ability to easily pick up new programming languages. I am experienced in Javascript, Ruby, Rais, React and React Native.

My diverse experience and scientific educational background has enabled me to develop into an team-member with excellent creative, interpersonal and problem-solving skills. I am excited to begin a career which will allow for life-long learning and am keen to begin contributing my own work and ideas to the industry.

## Skills

**Problem-solving**
- I studied Biochemistry for one year at Imperial College London, where I learnt how to solve problems methodically during weekly lab sessions. 
- I achieved an A* in GCSE Mathematics one year early and have always been adept at problem-solving and self-motivating. I thrive in logical subjects and am always challenging myself. 
- In my spare time, I enjoy logical games and I have recently surpassed 1000 points on Codewars.

**Self-teaching**
- Before enrolling at Makers, I self-taught for six months and became proficient in both Ruby and Python, during which time I became adept at managing my own learning, time and workload.
- I am undertaking CS50s Introduction to Computer Science online course to gain a broader understanding of Computer Science and gain familiarity with new languages including C and SQL.
- Whilst working at the gym, fitness became increasingly imprtant to me and I recognised the potential benefits of developing a more thorough understanding of physiology and efficient training. I would be better able to assist customers and my own ability to train would be improved. As a result, I undertook ad  successfully completed an online Personal Training qualification with Premier Global in 2019.

**Communication and Team Work**
- Acting requires excellent communication skills. The ability to build meaningful and trusting relationships is incredibly important as every new job begins with a new team. As a result, relationship-building and teamwork comes naturally to me and I am an active listener, an avid learner and am always looking for new ways to contribute to a team.
- While working at Mob45, I built rapport with customers which helped to foster customer loyalty. On numerous occasions, customers were dissuaded from trying out other gyms because their experience at ours was so enriched by positive interactions with staff and the welcoming environment created by us.
